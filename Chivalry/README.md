# CHIVALRY: The preferred language of the middle age

This language was created by Vance Elliott as part of the honors programming languages curriculum at Westminster in the Spring 2021.

#The Basics

## Variables

When travelling on a perilous journey, one often has to delegate work to squires. Any respected knight knows to give items and tasks to measley servants, allowing one's hands to be unburdened for any battles that may arise. 

### Declarations

When hiring a squire, there is very little work for the knight to do. The Chivalry language takes it upon itself to seek the local inns and taverns for worthy servants. All the user must do is use the keyword `squire` followed by a name and preceded by a type.

For example: `num squire Jonathan`

There are three main types of squires available:

1. num squires
1. word squires
1. truth squires

Since math is difficult, our squires require a calculator for decimals. If you would like to give a squire a calculator use this syntax: `num squire Jonathan calc included`.

### Donning items to thou squires

Once a knight has enlisted the help of several townsfolk, 
one can give these people items, corresponding with their type.

To do so, use the command `give`

For example, `give(Jonathan, 4)`

### Changing thy item of thou squires

Squires cannot hold two things at once, so if you were to give a new item to a squire, they would drop the item they were currently holding.

There are several ways to modify an item held by a squire:

- num squires
    1. the command `combine` will add two numbers together
    2. the command ``
